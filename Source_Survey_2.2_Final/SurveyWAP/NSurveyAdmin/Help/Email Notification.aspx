                The email notification feature is part of the Settings screen. It's purpose is to send an email message each
                time a survey has been answered.  <br /> <br />There are three types of notifications:<br />
                <br />
                * <span style="text-decoration: underline">Short Message</span> This will send an email
                with a brief text stating that someone has answered the survey .<br />
                <br />
                * <span style="text-decoration: underline">Full Entry</span> This will send a complete
                report where all the questions are shown including those that were not
                answered.<br />
                <br />
                * <span style="text-decoration: underline">Answers Only</span>This will send a partial
                report where only answered questions will be shown.<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Once the preferred notification type is chosen further (email)settings are shown:
                <br />
                <br />
                * <span style="text-decoration: underline">Email From</span>: the email address
                from which the notification will be sent.<br />
                <br />
                * <span style="text-decoration: underline">Email Notification To</span>: the email
                address that will receive the notification.<br />
                <br />
                * <span style="text-decoration: underline">Email Notification Subject</span>: the
                subject of the notification email.<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Before using the email Notification options make sure that the (SMTP) mail server
                is setup correctly either during the installation or afterwards: check the web.config
                file's "mail server settings" in the SurveySetting section.

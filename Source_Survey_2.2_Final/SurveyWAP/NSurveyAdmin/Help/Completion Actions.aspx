                Once the respondents have finished answering the survey and submitted their answers
                Survey can be setup to trigger a completion action to run at the end of the survey. 
                Available completion actions are:<br />
                <br />
                <b>&quot;Thank you&quot; Message Action</b><br />
                <br />
                This option will show a text/html message to the respondent once the survey
                is finished. It could be used to thank the user or possibly provide some information
                about the survey taken. <br />
                <br />
                * Edition Language<br />
                This is the language in which the &quot;Thank You&quot; message text is edited and
                in which language it will be shown. A language can be selected, the text changed
                and when the update button is clicked the text will be assigned to the selected
                language.<br />
                <br />
                This feature is only available if Survey's <a href="Multi-Languages Settings.aspx" title="Multi Languages">Multi Languages Settings</a>
                are activated.<br />
                <br />
                * Thanks Message<br />
                This is the message that will be shown to the end user once the survey is completed.
                <br />
                <br />
                <b>URL Redirection Action</b><br />
                <br />
                This action will redirect the user to a specific page or URL once the survey is completed.<br />
                <br />
                * Edition Language<br />
                The language for which the redirection will occur. This is also the language in
                which the &quot;Thank You&quot; message text is edited and in which language it
                will be shown.<br />
                <br />
                This feature is only available if Survey's <a href="Multi-Languages Settings.aspx" title="Multi Languages">Multi Languages Settings</a>
                are activated.<br />
                <br />
                * Thanks Message<br />
                This is the message that will be shown to the end user once the survey is completed.
                This message will only show up if no redirection URL is specified. It is mostly
                used in case of multiple languages and a redirection is used for one language but
                not for the others.<br />
                <br />
                * Redirection URL<br />
                This is the URL to which the user will be redirected. It must be in following format: http://www.yourdomain.com or 
                http://www.youdomain.com/yourpage.aspx<br />

Report filters will allow us to setup a set of rules based on our
survey's questions and answers. Once we have created a filter and added
rules to it, we can assign it to a Report%20General%20Settings.html or a
RI_Introduction.html . Once a filter as been applied all results
calculation will be done accordingly to the filter that has been set up.<br />
<br />
* Filter Name is the name of the filter that will contain the rules.<br />
<br />
* Conditional Rule Operator is the operator that Survey will use to
  evaluate the rules inside the filter. At this time only a single
  conditional operator (AND, OR) can be applied to a group of rules
  inside a filter.<br />

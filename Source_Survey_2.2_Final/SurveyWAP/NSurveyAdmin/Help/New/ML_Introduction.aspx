There are often times when we have a worldwide audience of respondent who
dont speak the same language and are not always knowing English. We could
create for each language separate surveys but this would results in big
complications while compiling and aggregating the final results.<br />
<br />
Survey has the flexibility to translate a single survey into multiple
languages and let the respondent choose in which language he wants to
take the survey.<br />
<br />
At the end of the survey Survey's Report%20General%20Settings.html will
provide us a way to either have a global look at our results or a more
granular look per respondent's languages.<br />
<br />
We can also check the MultiLanguage_Introduction.html in order to learn
more about the multi-languages features of Survey.<br />
<br />
Survey engine handles also languages written from right to left, like
Arabic.<br />

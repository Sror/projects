This report item will allow us to see for multiple choices question the
combination of choices answered by a single respondent.<br />
<br />
Suppose we have following multiple choices question :<br />
What do you drink ?<br />
 [] Pepsi<br />
 [] Water<br />
 [] Milk<br />
 [] Fanta<br />
<br />
Using the other report items we would only be able to know either the
total of answers for all choices or the total number of individual
respondent of the question.<br />
<br />
Using IRMA we can know exactly for the reach of individual respondent for
the different answers combinations of the question.<br />
<br />
IRMA offer us two different analysis method.<br />
<br />
1) We can choose specific answers and see the reach for the combination
of these answers.<br />
<br />
2) We can choose a number of combinations of answers and IRMA will
calculate the different combinations along with their individual
respondent reach.<br />
<br />

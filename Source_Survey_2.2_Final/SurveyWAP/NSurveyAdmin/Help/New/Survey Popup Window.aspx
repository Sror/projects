Survey allows us to deploy our survey through invitation popup windows.
We can set a specifc frequency to the window and based on it show the
invitation only after a given number of people have visited the page on
which the popup code is hosted.<br />
<br />
The popup window is simulated using a DHTML generated window and is fully
compatible with browsers having popup blocker activated.<br />
<br />
Popup Settings<br />
<br />
* Show Popup Every is the frequency of visitors the popup should be
  shown to. A cookie is set on each visitors machine to prevent having a
  visitor to be counted twice in the frequency count.<br />
   <br />
  It is recommended to put a 0 value during testing as this will always
  show the window .<br />
<br />
* Open In New Window alllows us to open the survey inside a new window. <br />
<br />
* Edition Language  is the language in which we are currently editing
  the title, link text and popup message.<br />
<br />
  This feature is only available if we have turned on Survey's
  ML_Introduction.html features.<br />
<br />
* Get Language From allows us to choose from which source Survey will
  try to get the language code in order to get the correct translation
  for the popup window.<br />
<br />
  This feature is only available if we have turned on Survey's
  ML_Introduction.html features.<br />
<br />
* Popup Title is the title shown at the top of the popup window.<br />
<br />
* Popup Survey Link Text is the text of the link that will take the
  visitor to our survey.<br />
<br />
* Popup message  is the message that will be shown inside the popup
  window.<br />

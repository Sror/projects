The answer editor allows us to add new answers to our question.  By
default Survey offers already many types of answer items but as you can
see in the Form%20Architecture.html it is very easy to develop and add
our own answer items inside Survey.<br />
<br />

  answers label and default texts.<br />

suggest to read the documentation of each type individually as you need
it to build your survey.<br />

Report filters will allow us to setup a set of rules based on our
survey's questions and answers. Once we have created a filter and its
rule we can then assign it to aReport%20General%20Settings.html or
aRI_Introduction.html . Once a filter as been applied all results
calculation will be done accordingly to the filter that has been set up.<br />
<br />
Edit Filter Options<br />
<br />
* Filter Name is the name of the filter that will contain the rules.<br />
<br />
* Conditional Rule Operator is the operator that Survey will use to
  evaluate the rules inside the filter. At this time only a single
  conditional operator (AND, OR) can be applied to a group of rules
  inside a filter.<br />
<br />
Add New Rule To Filter<br />
We can choose a question from which we will select an answer for our
rule. Based on the answer type we have several more options :<br />
<br />
* Selection answer types have no extra features.<br />
<br />
* Text entry answers allow us to setup an extra rule to see if the text
  entered match that rule. If we dont specifiy any text, Survey will
  consider the rule valid if any text has been entered by the respondent.<br />
<br />
Once we have created a new rule for the condition we can add any number
of new rules to the filter as we need. If we have more than one rule the
logical operator (AND, OR) of the filter will be used to evaluate the
rules together in the filter.<br />

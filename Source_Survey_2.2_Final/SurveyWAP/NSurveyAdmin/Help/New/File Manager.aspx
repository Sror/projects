The file manager lets us manage all the files that have been uploaded by
the respondent using the Extended%20-%20File%20Upload.html answer type.<br />
<br />
Uploaded Files<br />
We can see the list of uploaded files and download locally the files.
Note that we can also see the respondent answers details by clicking on
the &quot;Details&quot; link on the right of the &quot;Download&quot; link.<br />
<br />
Export All Files To Server's Directory<br />
If we have a huge number of files, downloading each file one by one can
quicly become a very cumbersome task.<br />
<br />
That's why we can also export all files that were uploaded to a directory
on the server. Note that we need to have &quot;write&quot; rights on the server
directory to which we will export the files.<br />
<br />
* Create File Group Directories<br />
<br />
  o No sub-directory groups will copy all the files inside the same
    directory.<br />
  o Voter Id group will group the files uploaded by the same
    respondent under the same directory.<br />
  o File-GUID sub-directory will group the files uploaded on the same
    answer item inside the same directory.<br />
<br />
* Full Path On Server is the complete path  of the directory on the
  server to which the files are going to be exported.<br />
